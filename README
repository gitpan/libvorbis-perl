                 http://synthcode.com/code/vorbis/

                             version 0.05
                           15 March, 2004

To install, type

  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make
  # make test
  # make install

The test of course is optional, but if it doesn't work the
installation probably won't.

man Ogg::Vorbis(3pm) for information on using the library, and
pogg(1p) for information on the pogg script.  Also see the general Ogg
Vorbis documentation available at http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/.
