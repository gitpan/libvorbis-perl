Description: Perl extension for Ogg Vorbis streams
 The Ogg::Vorbis Perl module, an object-oriented interface to the
 libvorbisfile Ogg Vorbis library.  Currently reading but not writing
 of streams is supported.  Includes a sample mpg123-like script for
 playing Ogg Vorbis files.
 .
 Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
 general-purpose compressed audio format for high quality (44.1-48.0kHz,
 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and variable bitrates
 from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis in the same class as
 audio representations including MPEG-1 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio
 (AAC and TwinVQ), and PAC.
